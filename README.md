# Learning Machine Learning. In Julia
Machine learning stuff in Julia (supervised: perceptron, SVM, neural network; unsupervised: clustering,...)

Stuff while learning Machine learning at [MITX 6.86x - Machine Learning with Python: from Linear Models to Deep Learning](https://www.edx.org/course/machine-learning-with-python-from-linear-models-to)

Theoretical notes are at the companion repository https://github.com/sylvaticus/MITx_6.86x, while this repository contains the Julia implementation.

This stuff most likely has value ony didactically, as the approaches are the "vanilla" ones, i.e. the simplest possible ones.

**Run the code by yourself (folder "notebooks") in myBinder, a temporary public online computational environment:
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sylvaticus/lmlj.jl/master)**

(Note: every first time after a commit is made in this repository, it takes a looong time as the temporary environment need to be created.)

By the way, if you are looking for an introductory book on Julia, have a look on my "[Julia Quick Syntax Reference](https://www.julia-book.com/)"(Apress,2019).
