# Notebook example

The following notebooks provide runnable examples of the package functionality:

- [Pegasus classifiers](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sylvaticus/Bmlt.jl/master?filepath=notebooks%2FPerceptron.ipynb)
- [Neural Networks](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sylvaticus/Bmlt.jl/master?filepath=notebooks%2FNn.ipynb)
- [Clustering](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sylvaticus/Bmlt.jl/master?filepath=notebooks%2FClustering.ipynb)


Note: the live, runnable computational environment is a temporary new copy on any connection. The first time after a commit is done on this repository a new environment has to be set instead of just being copied, and it may take several minutes.

This is only if you are the unlucky user triggering the event after the commit.
